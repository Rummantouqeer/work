/*Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
 with the person’s name.*/


let FriendsArray = ["rumman","neha","fariha"];

console.log(FriendsArray[0],"we are best friends")
console.log(FriendsArray[1],"we are best friends")
console.log(FriendsArray[2],"we are best friends")
