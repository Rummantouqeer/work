//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add atleast one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

console.log(Name); //this will give output of my name
const date = ("5 november"); //here const data type will store number in string
console.log(date);
